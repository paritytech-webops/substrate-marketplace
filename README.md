- `GATSBY_MARKETPLACE_URL`: Substrate Marketplace website (repo: https://github.com/paritytechmarcomms/substrate-marketplace)
- `GATSBY_SITE_URL`: represent this project

Default localhost port configuration:

```env
#platform projects:
GATSBY_WEBSITE_URL=http://localhost:8100
GATSBY_DOCS_URL=http://localhost:8200
GATSBY_MARKETPLACE_URL=http://localhost:8300

# match port number of the project you work on:
GATSBY_SITE_URL=http://localhost:{project port}
```

**Start development server**

Navigate into your new siteâ€™s directory and use the following command to start the development server locally.

```shell
yarn develop
```

## Setup, configuration & plugins

### i18n (currently not in use)

Docs:

- https://github.com/microapps/gatsby-plugin-react-i18next#how-to-extract-translations-from-pages
- https://www.i18next.com
- https://react.i18next.com

#### Configuration

You can find the config for i18n, using i18next with `gatsby-plugin-react-i18next`.

- the markdown content is located in `./content/{language}/{content_type}/*`/
- the language strings are located in `./locales/{language}/{data_type}.json`

The default language (and fallback language) is `en` for english.

#### Extract strings

To extract the strings that needs to be translated, it is possible to run `yarn extract-locales`, which will generate the `/locales-tmp` folder.

### netlify-cms (currently not in use)

`netlify-cms-app` & `gatsby-plugin-netlify-cms` are used to setup `[netlify-cms](https://www.netlifycms.org)` for this project.

The gatsby gatsby-config pluggin, points to the file `src/cms/index.js`, as entry file of the configuration.

#### local git-gateway backend

To develop and use netlify-cms with the data available in the local repository folder:

In the file `./.env.development` set:

```
GATSBY_NETLIFY_CMS_GIT_LOCAL=true
```

Then in the project's root folder run:

```
npx netlify-cms-proxy-server
```

and in an other shell and the same folder, run the development server as usual.
